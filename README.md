# 50.003 Project Android App

This is our Android application for the 50.003 module, Elements of Software Construction held in SUTD. It is a remote Know Your Customer application for identity verification.

This Android app interfaces with our remote Python server. For more details, please visit the [main server repository](https://github.com/132lilinwei/newsite).

## Functionality

Our Android app allows two main functions:

1. User registration
2. User authentication

We validate input entered by a user, sending it to our server if it passes our frontend validation checks. We also make use of the Android camera features to allow the user to upload a photo to the server.

## Requirements

Android Studio version ?

## Unimplemented Features

* DigiCard implementation for interfacing with server-side
